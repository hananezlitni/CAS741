The simplex method, a linear programming algorithm, is considered one of the 
most popular algorithms that has significant influence in the fields of science 
and engineering \cite{simplex-popularity}. 

The algorithm can be used in a variety of fields and its goal is to make the 
most of the available resources to achieve the optimal solution. For example, 
the simplex method is used in the sand casting process to optimize the sand 
casting parameters to produce the best results \cite{sand-casting}. Moreover, 
the simplex method was used in chemistry to maximize the yield of a chemical 
reaction \cite{chemistry}.

Since the simplex method has various applications in different fields, a 
software that facilitates solving objective functions using the simplex method 
for different purposes can be useful. Therefore, I propose the development of a 
library containing simplex method solvers. It would output the optimal solution 
of the objective function that satisfies its constraints and achieves the 
desired goal (maximization or minimization) given the objective function, the 
objective function goal (maximization or minimization) and the linear 
constraints that the objective function is subject to.

To use the library, basic knowledge of linear programming is assumed, but no 
technical background is required. The library will be operable on different 
platforms, including Mac and Windows.
